# Jumper üêá
Jumper is a well made data manager for phone numbers, credit cards and passwords made with Python.
This is actually my first programming project; when I started I spent 3 months to do it but one week ago I decided to make it public, so I wrote it again with a better code and I implemented a really nice graphic user interface.
